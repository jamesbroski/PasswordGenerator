# PasswordGenerator

In this assignment, we were asked to create a password generator from already established HTML & CSS code files
Our foucs was to solely write our code in an external Javascript file, "script.js"

Our goal was to allow the user to be able to generate a random password based on specific criteria they had selected. These criteria were:
1. Special Characters
2. Numeric Characters
3. Lowercase Characters
4. Uppercase Characters

The user needed to choose a password length between 8 and 128 characters. The password generator would then create a password for the user once all the criteria was confirmed. 

The user was led through prompts + confirm functions throughout the password generation process

Below is an example of what a prospective user will see when engaing with the password generator:

Overall, this was a great activity! Learning how Javascript can help developers not only make our websites more functional and dynamic, but also more efficient utilizing functions and arrays. Excited to learn even more!
